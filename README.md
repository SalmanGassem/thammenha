Tuwaiq Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Capstone

The current situation in the Saudi Used Car Market is in dire need of tools and services to simplify the process of evaluating cars.

### Problem Statement
Websites issues:
 1. Unregulated pricing.
 2. Personal opinions.
 3. Unreliable.

Going in person to the physical market also has its drawbacks:

 1. Evaluations are always below actual value.
 2. Unfair pricing.
 3. Can be easily taken advantage of.
 4. Inconvenient.
 5. Weeks to find out the market value
 6. Financial Overhead
 7. Time cost

## Solution

Develop a Machine Learning model that learns from the KSA Used Car market to be able to estimate the prices properly.

#### Objectives:
 - Collect local used car data.
 - Create a Machine Learning model using the data collected.
 - Develop a separate model on a separate dataset for comparison purposes.

#### Implementation Plan:
 - Deliver the service through a website.
 - Create an API for the model.
 - Users enter features to find their carâ€™s value.

### Data Collection

 - The KSA data was scraped from the website Syarah.com.
 - Collected a dataset from the USA market to compare from websites such as Kaggle, Medium, and so on.

### Model Training

The model training is still undergoing.

### EDA for the Saudi Data

The dataset consists of the following columns:

'brand', 'model', 'year', 'price', 'kilometer', 'fuel_type', 'gear_type', 'engine_size', 'drivetrain', 'trim', 'exterior_color', 'interior_color', 'seat_number', 'origin'
