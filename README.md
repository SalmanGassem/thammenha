The current situation in the Saudi Used Car Market is in dire need of tools and services to simplify the process of evaluating cars.

Websites are:
 1. Unregulated pricing.
 2. Personal opinions.
 3. Unreliable.

Going in person to the physical market also has its drawbacks:

 1. Evaluations are always below actual value.
 2. Unfair pricing.
 3. Can be easily taken advantage of.
 4. Inconvenient.
 5. Weeks to find out the market value
 6. Financial Overhead
 7. Time cost
